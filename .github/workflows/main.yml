# A push on master will build, test and publish Jeka on OSSRH.
# Beside it will push the built documentation on the Jeka landing page.

# If a tag is present on the last commit, Jeka will publish versioned artifacts according tag name on OSSRH public repo.
# If no tag is present, the built artifacts will be published to OSSRH snapshot repository.
# This logic is implemented within the Jeka build.
